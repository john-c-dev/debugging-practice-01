# Task Manager - Debugging Practice

This is a simple Task Manager application designed to help you practice your debugging skills. The application has several intentional errors in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that you need to identify and fix.

## Expected Behavior

When working correctly, the Task Manager should:

1. Allow users to add new tasks with a priority level (High, Medium, Low)
2. Display tasks in a list with appropriate styling based on priority
3. Allow users to mark tasks as complete (which adds a strikethrough)
4. Allow users to delete tasks
5. Filter tasks by priority level
6. Show notifications when tasks are added, completed, or deleted
7. Store tasks in localStorage so they persist between page refreshes

## User Interface

- **Header**: Title and description of the application
- **Add Task Form**: Input field for task text, dropdown for priority selection, and submit button
- **Task List**: Display of tasks with completion and delete buttons
- **Filter Buttons**: Buttons to filter tasks by priority
- **Notifications**: Temporary notifications for user actions

## How to Use (Once Debugged)

1. Enter a task in the input field
2. Select a priority from the dropdown
3. Click "Add Task" button to add the task to the list
4. Use the checkmark button to toggle task completion
5. Use the "Ã—" button to delete a task
6. Use the filter buttons to show tasks of specific priority levels

## Files

- `index.html` - The structure of the application
- `style.css` - The styling for the application
- `scripts.js` - The functionality of the application

## Your Challenge

Find and fix all the errors in these files to make the application work as expected. The errors include syntax errors, logical errors, typos, and other common mistakes that developers encounter.

Good luck with your debugging practice!
